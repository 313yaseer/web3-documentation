# What is a Gas Fee?

A gas fee is the transaction cost required to execute operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: Compensates validators for computational resources
- **Calculation**: Gas Used × Gas Price
- **Payment**: Always paid in ETH (even for token transfers)
- **Variability**: Changes based on network congestion

## How Much Do Gas Fees Cost?

Gas fees fluctuate between:
- **Low activity**: 10-30 gwei (~$2-5 per transaction)
- **High activity**: 100-300 gwei (~$20-100 per transaction)

## How to Save on Gas Fees

1. **Time your transactions**: Use during off-peak hours (weekends, late night UTC)
2. **Adjust gas settings**: Use slower confirmation for non-urgent transactions
3. **Batch transactions**: Combine multiple operations when possible
4. **Use Layer 2**: Consider Arbitrum, Optimism, or Polygon for cheaper fees
