# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What blockchain do you use?
We operate on Ethereum Mainnet. We're also exploring Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism) for lower fees.

Your wallet keys remain in your control. We never have access to your private keys or seed phrase. Always verify you're on the official website before connecting.

### What are the fees?

- Staking: No platform fee, only gas for transactions

## Wallet Questions

### Which wallets are supported?
- MetaMask (browser & mobile)
- WalletConnect (any compatible wallet)
- Coinbase Wallet
- Ledger hardware wallet

### Can I use mobile?
Yes! Use MetaMask mobile app or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet.

### I lost my seed phrase. Can you help?
Unfortunately, no. Seed phrases are the ONLY way to recover wallets. We don't have access to them. This is why crypto is "trustless" - only you control your funds.

## Transaction Questions

### Why is my transaction pending?
Usually due to low gas price or network congestion. You can:

2. Speed up transaction (higher gas)
3. Cancel and retry with higher gas

### How long do transactions take?
- Normal: 15 seconds - 2 minutes
- Congested network: 5-30 minutes
- Very low gas: Hours (or may fail)

### Can I cancel a transaction?
Yes, while it's pending:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click pending transaction
3. Click "Cancel"
4. Confirm with higher gas than original
